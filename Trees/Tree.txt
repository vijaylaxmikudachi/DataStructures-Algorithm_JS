Tree:
A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. 
In this structure, each node contains a value or data and has references (edges) to other nodes, called children. 
The node at the top of the tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves. 
Trees are widely used in computer science for various purposes like 
representing hierarchical data, managing sorted data, and more.

Node: A single element in the tree that contains data and references to child nodes.
Root: The topmost node in the tree.
Child: A node connected to another node (parent).
Parent: A node that has one or more child nodes.
Leaf: A node with no children.
Edge: A connection between two nodes.

Binary Tree:

A binary tree is a specific type of tree data structure where each node has at most two children, 
referred to as the left child and the right child. 
This structure imposes a strict limit on the number of child nodes, 
making binary trees highly efficient for operations like searching, sorting, and hierarchical data storage.

Types of Binary Trees:
1.Full Binary Tree:     Every node has either 0 or 2 children (no node has only one child).

2.Perfect Binary Tree:  All interior nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

4.Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node 
                        is at most 1.

5.Degenerate or Skewed Tree: A tree where each parent node has only one child, 
                             resulting in a structure similar to a linked list.

Binary Search Tree (BST):

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree where nodes are organized according to specific rules:
Left Subtree: All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the value of the parent node.
Right Subtree: All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the value of the parent node.
This structure allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, 
with an average time complexity of O(log n) for balanced trees.
A BST helps in quickly finding elements because it narrows down the search path to 
either the left or right subtree based on comparisons.

Binary Tree: when we want to represent hierarchical data without needing to perform ordered operations 
             like searching, inserting, or deleting elements efficiently 
             (e.g., DOM structure, general tree representations).
Binary Search Tree (BST): when we need to maintain sorted data and perform efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
