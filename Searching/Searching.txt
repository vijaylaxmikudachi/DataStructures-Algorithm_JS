1. Linear Search
Linear search is the simplest search algorithm, where each element of the array is checked sequentially 
until the target element is found or the array is fully traversed.
Time Complexity:
Worst Case: O(n)
Best Case: O(1) (if the target is the first element)
Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Binary Search
Binary search is much more efficient than linear search, 
but it only works on sorted arrays. It works by repeatedly dividing the array in half and 
eliminating the half where the target cannot be.
Time Complexity:
Worst Case: O(log n)
Best Case: O(1) (if the target is the middle element initially)
Space Complexity: O(1)

When to Use:
Linear Search is useful for small or unsorted arrays.
Binary Search is optimal for sorted arrays.
Jump Search and Exponential Search are suitable for sorted arrays with specific performance needs.
Interpolation Search works well for uniformly distributed arrays.
